ActsAsExample
=============

This is a very simple ActiveRecord acts_as plugin skeleton designed to show you how you can build a simple plugin. There are lots of resources out there on this topic, but nothing helps more than a good example.

Feel free to modify this to suit your needs.

== Example usage

Mix the plugin into your model

   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_example
   end
   
Now call the class method that this plugin attaches

   User.latest_five
   
Now call the instance method that this plugin attaches.

   user = User.find :first
   user.to_example
   
See the actual acts_as_example.rb file for more details on usage.

== Tests

There's a sample unit test here too that covers the functionality provided. It's a decent example that I ripped off from acts_as_paranoid because it works well and it's simple enough to follow that you shouldn't get lost. I'd love to see someone submit a patch that would include specs...
